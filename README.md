# Mission_to_Mars

### Objective 
Our goal is to use web scrapping tools and preform data analysis on a mission to mars. Our first goal is to scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
Our second goal is to scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

### Results 

There are three main questions we wanted to find the answer to.
* Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest?
* Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest?
* How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year?

For the first question, the third and fourth months have the lowest temperature at just under -80.
The month with the highest temperature is the eith month with a temperature of just under -70.

For the final question, through following weather patterns we can estimate that there are just under 700 earth days in a martian year.
